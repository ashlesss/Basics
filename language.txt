Question: What is your favorite programming language? Why?

My favorite programming language is JavaScript, 
because I usually use js to design webpage. Among most of the frontend framework,
they all use either TypeScript or JavaScript.

Also not only JS can be used to write frontend, it also can be used to write
backend using like Node.js

But it has its own disadvantage, 
CommonJS is a weak type programming language, so I might write more TypeScript later.

Question: Is your favorite language the one you are also most experienced with? If not, which language are you most experienced with?

Yes, I have the most experienced with JavaScript.
